# Blop

Blop *(**Bl**og h**op**)*, is an entry for the
[Langjam gamejam](https://langjamgamejam.com/).

> Langjam Gamejam is a 7-day challenge to create a programming language and then
> use that language to build a game. You set the rules. Be as creative as
> possible, use any technologies you want, and have fun. There will be prizes
> for the most creative submissions!
>
> __Rules:__
> 1. The hackathon runs for 7 days
     *(starting on the 14th Decemeber 2025, at 04:59 UTC)*.
> 2. You must design and implement a programming language.
> 3. You must design and implement a game using your language.
> 4. You can use any language, engine, libraries, and technologies.
> 5. You define what a programming language is and what a game is.
> 6. Work solo or on a team.
> 7. Documentation and instructions are encouraged.
> 8. Bonus points: Write a blog post about your language, game, and design
     process.

Because of the special rule 8, you get bonus points for creating a blog post,
and because of this blop was born, because blop is *both* a game, and a blog
about the game *(itself)*, and how it was created.
